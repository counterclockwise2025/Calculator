# Hello everyone

This is a project that I worked on during my software design patterns class. The project was pretty lengthy and time consuming but I have uploaded the work. I have organized the work in a manner to guive an idea of the flow. 
The project starts off with building an array class (data structure) that implements all the method an array would need. Then the array class is used to build a stack, queue, and fixed array. Then these data structures were used to create a calculator using design patterns that we learned in the course.
This is a representation of the work that I have completed thus far and I plan to add on more to this.

*Calculators may NOT work as intended.*
